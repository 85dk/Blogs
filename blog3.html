JavaScript is the engine behind interactive and dynamic web experiences. In just 10 minutes, you can grasp its core concepts.

Start by understanding variables (`let`, `const`), data types(strings, numbers, arrays, objects), and basic functions that let you group reusable code. Learn how conditions and loops control the flow of logic. Most importantly, explore the DOM (Document Object Model) — JavaScript’s way of accessing and changing HTML elements. Even a short session with JS opens up endless possibilities to make your websites smarter, faster, and more engaging.
